# TpacTool

[TpacTool](https://github.com/szszss/TpacTool) - an open source asset explorer which can open TPAC format files, view and export the contents. [Fork](https://github.com/hunharibo/TpacTool).

## Model export

Before exporting a model, you need to [find it's mesh name](/modding/items/#how-to-find-itemid).

Point TpacTool to the BL folder:

Select Model and enter the mesh's name for the model you are searching (sturgia_helmet_c in example), select it in the found results:

If it's Rigged, select Rigged, Human skeleton (if it's human, could be horse, etc). Select if you need textures and then export:
