While all is selected, click at the bottom right to get this popup and find your desired heightmap:

Next two popups will be scale and offset.

Scale -> trial and error:

Offset -> don't touch:

Once you go here, you use the landscape shaper tool to see the height of the lowest point and highest point while hovering. this will give you a rough estimate of what you need to change with your input in scale:

Then simply repeat the import step and test the height again.
