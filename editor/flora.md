# Flora


## Wide spacing for trees on the world map

(When drawn using paint layers)

!!! quote "I'm struggling with flora paint layer forests. However, I change the density, colony radius, colony threshold and weight, I can't get trees [close enough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1npGJ9p1ySdu2RDU19P_2aE-OCsKWie_G02vcws36UIs/edit)."

This happens when the map is saved under the custom name.

Save/load your map as Main_map and spacing will be OK.
