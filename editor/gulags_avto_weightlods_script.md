## Hand Morphs

![](/pics/hand_morphs_script.gif)

Prerequisites: Need rigged hand model :handMRef_Rigged . Need your new hand, Your mesh must be weight painted already.

1. Import the Rigged hand and Your weighted mesh, duplicate your weight painted mesh, , remove the armature and any     vertex groups manually,select imported handMRef_Rigged and your duplicated mesh, and Press the weight paint     button, select duplicated mesh, generate data layers and apply modifier.
2. You must cycle through the animation frames to see if the weight paint looks okay, if not then fix it , once it      looks good to you then can hide the imported handMRef_Rigged
2. With duplicated model selected Click button: Generate Morph Targets , it generates 25 morphs 
4. Select all 25 morphs, and your original weight painted mesh (26 items selected in total)
5. Click button: Assign Morph Targets, Done.
