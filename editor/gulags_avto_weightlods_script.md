Delete non-active groups, that do not impact the mesh (all blue):

## LODs

Select your mesh. Make sure it has correct name (which you will not be able to change in the BL Editor)

Newly generated LOD starts from 0.8 Decimate Ratio, then 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 ...

Set how many LODs to generate and press the "Generate LODs" button:
