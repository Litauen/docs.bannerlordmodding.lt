These menu backgrounds are culture related.

They are saved in the /GUI/SpriteParts/ui_fullbackgrounds

Names:

- CULTURE_alley.png
- CULTURE_arena.png
- CULTURE_keep.png
- CULTURE_tavern.png

When adding these for your custom culture, make sure you extract/include all the vanila PNGs as well. Otherwise you will be missing a lot of menu backgrounds.
