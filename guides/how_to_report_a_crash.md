# How to report a crash

Crash report without a crash log is not very helpful. To get a crash log follow these steps:

1. Install [ButterLib](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2018){_target=blank} mod

2. Make sure it's active

3. `Disable when Debugger is Attached` option (with new ButterLib versions crash will not be generated when this option is ON)

    ??? info "Show where"

4. Play the game, wait for the crash (exception)

5. Do as said in the image:

6. Also add a description what you were doing when the crash happened.
