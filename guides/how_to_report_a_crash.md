# How to report a crash

Report without a crash log is not very helpful. To get a crash log follow these steps:

1. Install [Butterlib](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2018){_target=blank} mod

2. Make sure it's active

3. Play the game, wait for the crash (exception)

4. Do as said in the image:
