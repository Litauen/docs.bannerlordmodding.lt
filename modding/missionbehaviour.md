# MissionBehaviour

- [Community Doc](https://docs.bannerlordmodding.com/_csharp-api/mountandblade/missionbehaviour/)

Mission Behaviours are used to control the [Mission](/modding/missions/). This can be anything from spawning [Agents](/modding/agents/) to adding boundaries for the Mission. A mission can have any amount of mission behaviours.

[MissionLogic](/modding/missionlogic/) and [MissionViews](/modding/mission_views/) are both types of MissionBehaviours (they inherit MissionBehaviour).
