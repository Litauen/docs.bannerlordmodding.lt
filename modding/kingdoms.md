# Kingdoms

## Notes

Kingdom can exist without owning a Town. Castle is enough. (It was stated somewhere otherwise)

With the existing Culture to create a Kingdom it is necessary to have:

- Castle or Town
- 1 Clan - the owner of the Castle/Town
- 1 Lord - the owner of the Clan/Kingdom

XML info on relations [here](/modding/xml/).

Not necessary:

- Spouse
- Dead lords
