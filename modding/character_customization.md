### Male Hair

### Beards

NPC99: TW sharing the 15th digit between hair styles and beards wasn't a clever plan for making face-codes moddable IMO.

### Female Hair

Female hair is determined by 15th and 16th digits of the 128 digit face/body keys. Digits are in hex - max 16 possibilities for one digit, forcing use of two digits to cover all options.

### Female Tattoos

### Skin Colors

NPC99: I presume there are a full 16 colours (hex) for each of the four 3rd digit (blue) options even though the character creater only samples 6 of each. The ranges demonstrate how the sequences work.
