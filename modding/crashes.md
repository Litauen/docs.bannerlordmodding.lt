## NullReferenceException

    Message: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

    Source: SandBox

??? failure "GetSuitableSpear - PrepareGuardAgentDataFromGarrison - TakeGuardAgentFromGarrisonTroopList - CreateStandGuardWithSpear"
    I'm getting this crash whenever I take a settlement with my custom culture and try to go to Lord's hall or dungeon
    <br>
    REASON: Custom culture guards entries in spgenericcharacters.xml (sandbox folder) need to go in spnpcharacters.xml in your mod's folder

</p>

    Source: TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem



??? failure "CampaignObjectManager - InitializeCachedData - InitializeOnNewGame - OnInitialize - DoLoadingForGameType"
    REASON: Settlement bound="Settlement.town_CR4" pointed to the non-existing settlement in settlements.xml
</p>


??? failure "GetHeroesForEffectiveRelation - ApplyInternal - CreateRebelPartyAndClan - StartRebellionEvent - DailyTickSettlement"
    REASON: ?


??? failure "BuildWorkshopForHeroAtGameStart - BuildWorkshopsAtGameStart - OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp"
    REASON: Used non-existant equipment set for NPCCharacter: &lt;EquipmentSet id="npc_gentry_equipment_sturgia"/>

??? failure "GetBodyProperties - GetCharacterCode - set_Character - set_Troop - PartyCharacterVM - InitializePartyList"
    REASON: Used non-existant BodyProperty for NPCCharacter


??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetDistance"
    REASON1: Wrongly assigned Settlement, Kingdom without a settlement. Attach dnSpy, it will show faction.FactionMidSettlement == null. Fix your XML.
    <br><br>
    REASON2: Problems with Navmesh. Inaccessible settlements. Old/mismatching settlements_distance_cache.bin - fix navmesh, regenerate settlements_distance_cache.bin 
    <br><br>
    Once I loaded Lemmy's map together with mine and got this crash Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
    <br><br>
    **CampaignObjectManager.InitializeCachedData()**
    <br><br>
    REASON: settlements.xml error - I accidently deleted one settlement and village had no bounded castle (crash on settlement.OwnerClan.OnBoundVillageAdded(settlement.Village);). This was on new game start.

??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetDistance - VillageGoodProductionCampaignBehavior - DistributeInitialItemsToTowns - OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp"
    REASON: it happens when a village is too far away from a city (even if the village belongs to a castle) but there is a script to fix that <br>
    SOLUTION: : The problem solved by having to make a town closer to the castle, and raise the trade bound system to 4000 ([more info](https://discord.com/channels/411286129317249035/761302555308720148/1235320061468868709))

??? failure "SpawnNotablesIfNeeded - NotablesCampaignBehavior - DailyTickSettlement"
    REASON: Some type of notable is missing for some culture. I was missing RuralNotable<br>
    Set in &lt;notable_and_wanderer_templates> in culture XML

??? failure "CalculateAverageWage - DoLoadingForGameType - DoLoadingForGameManager"
    REASON: ??? (maybe something related to party templates with non-existant troop IDs, but not confirmed)

??? failure "CharacterObject - GetSkillValue - DefaultPartyMoraleModel - GetMoraleEffectsFromSkill - GetEffectivePartyMorale"
    REASON: used not existant troop ID in the &lt;MBPartyTemplate id="villager_CUSTOM_CULTURE_template"><br>
    HINT: Check Encyclopedia-Troops if necessary troop is actually in the game.

??? failure "DefaultPartyWageModel - GetTotalWage - MobileParty - get_TotalWage - get_LimitedPartySize - CalculateGarrisonChangeInternal"
    REASON: Troop ID used in partyTemplates.xml refers to a non-existing troop ID in the trooptree. 

??? failure "SetInitialValuesFromCharacter - CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero - CreateMinorFactionHeroFromTemplate - SpawnMinorFactionHeroes - OnNewGameCreated"
    REASON1: spclans.xslt and custom_spclans.xml were in a separate folder for spclans, but missing empty spclans.xml file<br>
    REASON2: for Lord NPCCharacter used EquipmentSet instead of EquipmentRoster


??? failure "HeroCreator - CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero - CreateMinorFactionHeroFromTemplate - SpawnMinorFactionHeroes - OnNewGameCreated"
    REASON: error in &lt;minor_faction_character_templates>, I used name= instead of id=



??? failure "HeroCreator - CreateNewHero - FindRandomInternal - CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero"
    REASON: error in XSLT by assigning a culture to a hero

??? failure "SiegeTowerSpawner - AssignParameters - SpawnerEntityMissionHelper - OnPreInit"
    On starting the scene. <br>
    REASON: name property for siege_tower entity:
    ``` xml
    <game_entity name="siege_tower_5m_spawner_right" prefab="siege_tower_5m_spawner">
    ```
    removed name=... solved the crash:
    ``` xml
    <game_entity prefab="siege_tower_5m_spawner">
    ```

??? failure "ArrangeDestructedMeshes - SetUpScene - AfterStart - FinishMissionLoading"
    REASON: siege engine can't find which wall segment to attack. Tag is missing. Commented out in xscene:
    ``` xml
    <game_entity name="easteurope_wall_level_l1_right" old_prefab_name="">
        <flags>
            <flag name="record_to_scene_replay" value="true"/>
        </flags>
        <tags>
            <tag name="right_wall"/>  <--- this was used by siege_engine >
        </tags>
        ...
    ```

??? failure "DestructableComponent - OnInit"
    The scene was working on L1 Summer/Winter/Sprint, crashing on L1/Fall and on all L2/L3<br>
    REASON: entity with DestructableComponent had debris_holder with season_mask="253". Removing the season_mask solved the crash:
    ``` xml
    <!-- <game_entity name="debris_holder" old_prefab_name="" mobility="1" season_mask="253"> FALL CRASH -->
    <game_entity name="debris_holder" old_prefab_name="" mobility="1"> <!-- NO CRASH -->
    ```

??? failure "BackstoryCampaignBehavior - OnNewGameCreated"
    REASON: commented out some native hard-coded lord/settlement <br>
    Check in BackstoryCampaignBehavior.OnNewGameCreated <br>
    Fix with Harmony to skip this native code:

    ``` cs
    [HarmonyPatch(typeof(BackstoryCampaignBehavior))]
    [HarmonyPatch("OnNewGameCreated")]
    public class BackstoryCampaignBehavior_OnNewGameCreated_Patch
    {
        public static bool Prefix()
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```


??? failure "CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero -  OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp - InitialChildGenerationCampaignBehavior"
    REASON: Hero present, lord not present, lord used in a clan definition as owner<br>
    REASON2: wrong id in &lt;xsl:template match="Settlement[@id='village_EN1_3']/@culture">


??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetDistance - UpdateFriendshipAndEnemies"
    REASON 1: Lord/hero without a proper clan (clan not created/deleted)
    <br><br>
    REASON 2: Incorrect load order when launching game, e.g. Lemmy's map was loaded after a mod using it.

??? failure "Kingdom - OnNewGameCreated - InvokeList - OnNewGameCreated"
    REASON: Deleted hero/lord, the 'owner' of the Kingdom


??? failure "CalculateDailyProductionAmount - GetWerehouseCapacity - TickProductions - OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp"
    REASON: assigned a settlement to non-existant clan<br>
    REASON2: error in defining minor_clan, I had label_color="FF7264D16" (one digit too much in the color code)

??? failure "NameGenerator - CalculateNameScore - SelectNameIndex - GenerateHeroFirstName - CreateSpecialHero - InitialChildGenerationCampaignBehavior - OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp"
    REASON: Clan's owner was non-existant Lord

??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetClosestSettlementForNavigationMesh - GetDistance - FindNearestSettlement - TryToAssignTradeBoundForVillage - UpdateTradeBounds"
    REASON: saved a Main_map when game was open, xscene file gone, map gone. Game started with vanilla Main_map with custom settlements.xml

??? failure "AgingCampaignBehavior - OnHeroComesOfAge - InvokeList - DailyTickHero"
    REASON: error/missing sandboxcore_equipment_sets.xml for the hero's culture. Hero turned 18

??? failure "TournamentGames - TournamentMatch - AddParticipant - TournamentBehavior - FillParticipants"
    REASON: RBM Tournament expects local culture troops in the settlement for the Tournament. Troops were not implemented for that culture.

??? failure "Clan - OnFortificationAdded - PreAfterLoad"
    REASON: Old save loaded on a new map with new settlements not present in the old save

??? failure "GangLeaderNeedsToOffloadStolenGoodsIssueBehavior - ConditionsHold - OnCheckForIssue - IssuesCampaignBehavior - CreateAnIssueForSettlementNotables"
    REASON: It's seems it is related to the mission NotableWantsDaughterFound. When it ends the GangLeader is spawned in the village where this mission was originated. This GangLeader then is used for this OffloadStolenGoods mission check and that results in the crash. Seems like native bug. I patched the crashing method with the check if village notable is not GangLeader.

??? failure "GauntletMovie - LoadMovie_Patch0 - Load - LoadMovie"
    REASON: Movie XML file not present. (deleted/wrong name/path?)

    REASON: No native settlement town_ES4 in the game.
