    Message: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

    Source: SandBox

??? failure "GetSuitableSpear - PrepareGuardAgentDataFromGarrison - TakeGuardAgentFromGarrisonTroopList - CreateStandGuardWithSpear"
    I'm getting this crash whenever I take a settlement with my custom culture and try to go to Lord's hall or dungeon
    <br>
    REASON: Custom culture guards entries in spgenericcharacters.xml (sandbox folder) need to go in spnpcharacters.xml in your mod's folder

??? failure "CampaignObjectManager - InitializeCachedData - InitializeOnNewGame - OnInitialize - DoLoadingForGameType"

    REASON: Used non-existant BodyProperty for NPCCharacter


??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetDistance"
    REASON1: Wrongly assigned Settlement, Kingdom without a settlement. Attach dnSpy, it will show faction.FactionMidSettlement == null. Fix your XML.
    <br><br>
    REASON2: Problems with Navmesh. Inaccessible settlements. Old/mismatching settlements_distance_cache.bin - fix navmesh, regenerate settlements_distance_cache.bin
    <br><br>
    **CampaignObjectManager.InitializeCachedData()**
    <br><br>
    REASON: settlements.xml error - I accidently deleted one settlement and village had no bounded castle (crash on settlement.OwnerClan.OnBoundVillageAdded(settlement.Village);). This was on new game start.

??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetDistance - VillageGoodProductionCampaignBehavior - DistributeInitialItemsToTowns - OnNewGameCreatedPartialFollowUp"
    REASON: ??

??? failure "SpawnNotablesIfNeeded - NotablesCampaignBehavior - DailyTickSettlement"
    REASON: Some type of notable is missing for some culture. I was missing RuralNotable<br>
    Set in &lt;notable_and_wanderer_templates> in culture XML

??? failure "CalculateAverageWage - DoLoadingForGameType - DoLoadingForGameManager"
    REASON: ??? (maybe something related to party templates with non-existant troop IDs, but not confirmed)

??? failure "CharacterObject - GetSkillValue - DefaultPartyMoraleModel - GetMoraleEffectsFromSkill - GetEffectivePartyMorale"
    REASON: used not existant troop ID in the &lt;MBPartyTemplate id="villager_CUSTOM_CULTURE_template"><br>

??? failure "SetInitialValuesFromCharacter - CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero - CreateMinorFactionHeroFromTemplate - SpawnMinorFactionHeroes - OnNewGameCreated"

??? failure "HeroCreator - CreateNewHero - FindRandomInternal - CreateNewHero - CreateSpecialHero"
    REASON: error in XSLT by assigning a culture to a hero

??? failure "SiegeTowerSpawner - AssignParameters - SpawnerEntityMissionHelper - OnPreInit"
    On starting the scene. <br>
    REASON: name property for siege_tower entity:
    ``` xml
    <game_entity name="siege_tower_5m_spawner_right" prefab="siege_tower_5m_spawner">
    ```
    removed name=... solved the crash:

    ```

??? failure "ArrangeDestructedMeshes - SetUpScene - AfterStart - FinishMissionLoading"
    REASON: siege engine can't find which wall segment to attack. Tag is missing. Commented out in xscene:

        </tags>
        ...
    ```

??? failure "DestructableComponent - OnInit"
    The scene was working on L1 Summer/Winter/Sprint, crashing on L1/Fall and on all L2/L3<br>
    REASON: entity with DestructableComponent had debris_holder with season_mask="253". Removing the season_mask solved the crash:
    ``` xml
    <!-- <game_entity name="debris_holder" old_prefab_name="" mobility="1" season_mask="253"> FALL CRASH -->
    <game_entity name="debris_holder" old_prefab_name="" mobility="1"> <!-- NO CRASH -->
    ```

??? failure "BackstoryCampaignBehavior - OnNewGameCreated"
    REASON: commented out some native hard-coded lord/settlement <br>
    Check in BackstoryCampaignBehavior.OnNewGameCreated <br>

    [HarmonyPatch("OnNewGameCreated")]
    public class BackstoryCampaignBehavior_OnNewGameCreated_Patch

    REASON: Clan's owner was non-existant Lord

??? failure "DefaultMapDistanceModel - GetClosestSettlementForNavigationMesh - GetDistance - FindNearestSettlement - TryToAssignTradeBoundForVillage - UpdateTradeBounds"
    REASON: saved a Main_map when game was open, xscene file gone, map gone. Game started with vanilla Main_map with custom settlements.xml
