# Create LODs

It can be done by hand, but believe me, you will hate doing this over and over and over again manually.

We will use amazing [script made by GulagEnablerüçâ](/editor/gulags_avto_weightlods_script/#lods).

Install it and use it. 1 click and it's done:

## Weapon LODs

!!! quote "PlebeianKilo [ER]:"

    For weapons game uses LOD1 in battle and LOD0 in crafting menu.

    That's why I remove LOD1 for weapons.

    If it looks fine in the crafting menu but off in a scene, remove the LOD1.
