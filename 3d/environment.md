# Environment

## Name

Decide the name for the project.

This helps me to keep organized.

For example I will do helmet found in Hrodno, so I will call whole project `lt_hrodno_helmet`:

`lt` marks my projects, so it's easy to find<br>
`hrodno` - unique helmet name<br>
`helmet` - type of the project

Do what's best for you, create your own system - it will pay off in the long run.


## Folders

I create a separate folder for each project, in it I have such folders:

`src` - for all files received from the modeller. Usually it's zip, textures and fbx files in original names. It's just like a backup<br>
`fbx` - [exported from Blender fbx files](/3d/export_to_fbx/), ready to be imported into the Editor<br>
`tex` - texture files ready to be imported into the Editor


## Textures

If textures are ok, I copy them from the `src` folder to the `tex` folder and rename with the project's name:
