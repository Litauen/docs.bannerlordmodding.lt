# Model Viewer

* [OFFICIAL: Model Viewer](https://moddocs.bannerlord.com/editor/resource-editors/model_viewer/)

## Open

Editor > Window > Show Model Viewer:

From the left panel, you can change Atmosphere, hide/show ground, or add as many entities as you want. The entities can either be Human or simple Mesh. Pressing Add Entity will open a modal window for you to select the entity type:

## Add human

To avoid super slow zoom I enlarge my human x10. That allows to look around him much much faster:

!!! tip "Holding SHIFT while zooming helps also"


## Add armors

Add armors to the `Body parts` section, not `Items`:

## Animation

For quick tests I am using:

* `lord_walk` - `lord_walk_forward` (good for normal movement testing)
* `run` - and the last from the list (easy to set) (good for extreme movement testing)
* `inventory` - `inventory_idle` (good for idle testing, for small details)

## Test horse caparison

Select Entity Model > Mesh:

![](/pics/2410061334.png)

Select caparison as `Mesh` and horse animations as shown:

Add horse as a second entity:

Set same animation as for caparison:

Click on `Animation Control` to start/stop animations until caparison and the horse are in sync (maybe there is a better way to sync animations?)

## Good armors for testing

Several armors that are bulky and are very good for testing with shoulder armors/gloves/shoes:

    vlandia_scale_armor
    mail_hauberk

### Bad [Weight Painting](/3d/weight_painting/)

Redo the [Weight Painting](/3d/weight_painting/). Fastest way - do [Weight Transfer](/3d/weight_painting/#weight-transfer).

## Model Viewer Problems

### Save/Load Scene

`File` - `Save Scene`/`Load Saved Scene` messes up the viewer, weird colors/shadows, no idea how to restore without the Editor restart:

### Closed window

If Model Viewer window is closed and then opened again from the menu - it does not work. 

Helps only Editor restart:
