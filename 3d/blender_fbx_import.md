# FBX import into Blender

## Import

In the new Blender's project delete all these:

![](/pics/2410021001.png)

File - Import - FBX:

![](/pics/2410021001b.png)

Leave default import settings:

![](/pics/2410021001c.png)

??? tip "When model is [exported from TpacTool](/resources/tpactool/#model-export) I use such settings:"
    ![](/pics/2410021001d.png)

Select your file and press Import FBX.

The model should be imported:

![](/pics/2410021001e.png)


## Rename

Double click on the imported mesh to rename it to [the project's name](/3d/environment/#name) (or any other name you like):

![](/pics/2410021007.png)

!!! warning "Make sure the name is unique - otherwise you will not be able to import it into the Editor."

This helps to keep organized, but most importantly - you will have a proper model name in the BL Editor, because you will not be able to rename it in the Editor itself.

In other words - what you enter here, you will be using everywhere, up to the XMLs.

!!! tip "The name can be lowercase - the Editor converts to lowercase anyway"


## Save

It's good practice to save your Blender project now.

I save it into my project's folder.
