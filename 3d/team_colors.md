# Team Colors

## Base Layer

Make sure you have white-light gray color on the parts where you will want team colors to be applied on top (dark base color will mess up the team color):

## Mask

Then you will need a mask (diffuse texture). Example:

* Black - will leave original texture / no change here
* Red - marks where the game will put primary team color
* Green - secondary team color

## Material

Set this mask as `Diffuse2Map` and check `use_double_colormap_with_mask_texture`:

## XML

Then in XML in the [item's](/modding/items/#xml) description make sure you have:

```xml
<Flags UseTeamColor="true"/>
```

## Color Variations

You can give half values to the color mask textures, something like 0.5. Then it will use both the base texture and the faction's team color in a blended way:
